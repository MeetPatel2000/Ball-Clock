# Ball-Clock
The ball clock uses movement to measure time, with balls representing minutes, five-minute intervals, and hours. By studying the predictable changes in ball order, the elapsed time can be determined. Commercial ball clocks lack a date indication. The program computes the time before ball order repetition, based on the number of balls.
